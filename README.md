SpaceX Launch Program

## Description

The site manages to fetch the number of launches by SpaceX Launch Program and uses given filters to fiter out between
* Launch Years
* Successful Launches
* Successful Landings

The site can do all the three filters together or each one individividually or two together. The code for filtering was written with both:
* If- Else-if Ladder
* Ternary Operator

The site does a GET request using [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) and fetches data. The fetched data is then passed as props to individual components and the components are rendered.

The application does not use a basic CSS styling. The elements were styled with [SASS / SCSS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass)
